# Data Plan

Purpose
- Define the data required for the project, describe collection and cleaning methods, storage, and provide a formal data dictionary.

Contents (suggested files)
- data-dictionary.md — canonical field definitions and schema
- data-sources.md — list of datasets, licenses, links, provenance
- ingestion/ — scripts for data retrieval and ingestion
- cleaning/ — cleaning scripts and notebooks (with reproducible steps)
- sample-data/ — small, sanitized sample dataset for reproducibility

Privacy, security, and compliance
- Describe any privacy concerns, IRB/ethics approvals needed, and how data access will be controlled.

Reproducibility
- All ingestion and cleaning steps should be scriptable; prefer saved scripts/notebooks, a requirements.txt or environment.yml, and a data provenance log.
